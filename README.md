RertroPico is "yet another" rp2040 handeld deivce. The whole project was done by me, alone, and i'm very prood of it!

The main goal was to make a cheap handheld capable of running a few 8 bits consoles on a home made tiny device, which can be "easily" (with a few soldering skills) done at a reasonable price. Finally, it would be totally open source, of course.

The cost of the device is currently ~30â‚¬ for the components (and shipping). Building instructions and documention is in the work.

The "retropico" os currently support four 8 bits consoles indlucing the nes, gameboy, master system and gamegear.

While a lot of work have been put in porting the emulated systems (including 60fps, sram support, ...), the emulation is far from perfect. A few games wont run, more will have graphical glitches, but the fun is here.
